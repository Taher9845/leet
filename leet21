Hint
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.


Example Walkthrough:
Input:

python
Copy code
original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
m = 2
n = 3
res = []
Execution:

First Iteration (r = 0):

start = 0 * 3 = 0
end = 0 + 3 = 3
original[0:3] = [1, 2, 3]
Append [1, 2, 3] to res.
res = [[1, 2, 3]].
Second Iteration (r = 1):

start = 1 * 3 = 3
end = 3 + 3 = 6
original[3:6] = [4, 5, 6]
Append [4, 5, 6] to res.
res = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].
End of Loop:

The loop ends after m = 2 iterations.
Return res.
Output:

python
Copy code
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]


SOLUTION:M
class Solution:
    def construct2DArray(self, original: List[int], m: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if m*n!=len(original):
            return []
        res=[]
        for r in range(m):
            start=r*n
            end=start+n
            res.append(original[start:end])
        return res
